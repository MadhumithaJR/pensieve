                            <p>Remus Lupin arrives at Shell Cottage. He could not believe it. Merely moments ago, he had held in his arms tenderly the bundle that was his child - their child - Teddy. He could not be prouder of Teddy and Tonks. Teddy was not a werewolf. Remus was so relieved he had cried into Tonks's arms. What was more, he was a metamorphmagus, like his mother. Remus was bursting with joy. He did not remember being this happy for as long as he could think of. He smiled at the thought that Teddy might grow up to become an unbeatable prankster like himself and Tonks.</p><p>He arrived at Bill and Fleur's residence, looking for Harry.</p><p>"We are parents to a baby boy - Teddy!" He cried, tears threatening to spill again.</p><p>"Harry, would you be his Godfather?" He put forth the question he had been burning to ask. He wanted to apologise to Harry for the way he had acted the last time they had met. He knew Harry wanted to as well. He could read it on his face. But there were a lot of people around, and it would be awkward. He hoped Harry had forgiven him and saw his offer as an olive branch. Harry looked momentarily stunned. He had perhaps not expected this.</p><p>"Yes. Yes, it would be an honour," he beamed. And Remus sighed with relief, and held him tight.</p><p>As much as he would like to believe otherwise, Remus knew. He knew that neither he nor Tonks had much time left. A war at this point was inevitable. It was fast approaching. He could feel their numbered days ticking by. And he tried to savour them as much as he could. When - if - they died, and Teddy was left an orphan, Remus knew that Harry would love him like his own son. For no one but Harry could better understand what it is like to grow up without parents. Remus blinked away his tears, and wondered where he would have been right now if Harry hadn't made him realise the error in his ways that day. He wondered, if there would ever come a time when he would stop owing, first James - and now Harry - for all that they had done for him.</p>
