                            <p>"Do you, Remus John Lupin, hereby take Nymphadora Tonks as your wife?"</p><p>"I do."</p><p>Tonks grinned at Remus as he leaned into her and kissed her softly. The few people that were present applauded and cheered. These were dark times, and they were losing someone almost each day. And something as trivial as a wedding seemed silly. But maybe that was all the more reason to have it.</p><p>He hugged Tonks, and she held on to him fiercely. He smiled to himself as it always surprised him, that somehow, this girl who challenged the Weasley twins with her pranks and jokes had such a side to herself. But he loved her like he loved no one else.</p><p>"We are married!" Tonks beamed at Harry, showing him the ring, as they entered his aunt's house. "I'm sorry we couldn't have you. It was a rather quiet ceremony."</p><p>"The happy, little talks can be continued over dinner," Moody interrupted, and they began to follow the plan of the Seven Potters.</p><p>Remus crashed through the magical barrier around The Burrow with a profusely bleeding George Weasley. Harry helped him carry George inside. It had been Snape. Again. He had aimed a killing curse at Remus but had missed. If only Remus could get him back. Hermione and Kingsley arrived next. Remus was starting to get paranoid. Were the others okay? Was Tonks okay? As if in response, they arrived shortly.</p><p>"This one saved me, wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for him," she gasped, falling into his arms. Remus was relieved beyond words. He could not thank Ron enough. Bill and Fleur arrived at last.</p><p>"Mad-Eye's dead." </p>
