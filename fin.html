                            <p>Remus Lupin saw the dome like magical barrier around the castle, cast by the Hogwarts professors, shake and rattle. So far, they'd been able to keep Voldemort and his followers at bay. Their attacks had been powerful but the protection cast by themselves had been stronger. But something had happened. He could sense it. Something had happened that had angered Voldemort so much that he had proceeded to attack the castle himself. Needless to say, it was vicious. Cracks were beginning to appear on the barrier. He could feel the protection slowly ebb away.</p><p>"Tell Professor McGonagall we might need a few more wands this side," he heard Kingsley command.</p><p>"Remus!" He looked around.</p><p>"Tonks! Why did you come here?" This was one of the lesser protected sides of the castle, and he was mad at Tonks for coming here. Nevertheless, at least he could protect her now.</p><p>Tonks was running toward him, when they were thrown backward with several spells. Tonks fell over, bleeding, but got up as quickly. They fought the Death Eaters, feeling their end draw nearer, feeling their lives ooze out of them with each fired spell. But a small part of him still believed otherwise. It still believed that they would make it out of this, alive. They would see Teddy grow up and receive his letter and attend Hogwarts. Remus kept going. Something kept pushing him forward. Their sacrifices would not go in vain. He had faith - he had faith in Dumbledore, in the Professors, in the students - in every soul out there fighting for the greater good - above all, he had faith in Harry. He knew Harry would defeat Voldemort. He knew Teddy will not have to grow up in a dark, evil world. He knew it. And he had to keep going.</p><p>Tonks screamed. Remus ducked out of the way of a killing curse. She was running toward him. He tried to reach for her, but she pushed him aside. Remus saw a purple flame slash across her chest. Her arm had frozen in mid-air, as she had tried to hold his hand, but had pushed him away in the last moment. And had - and had - had taken the curse upon herself. She fell forward, he caught her. But she was not breathing, her eyes looked glassy, and they were wide with fear. Remus collapsed onto the ground. The last thing he saw, was a flash of green light.</p><p>That day, Remus Lupin broke, but he couldn't hold any longer.</p>
